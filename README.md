Customer Churn Analysis with Power BI and Excel

Overview

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing customer churn in the banking sector using Excel and Power BI. The goal is to explore the factors that influence customer retention and churn. By examining various demographics and behavior indicators, we can gain insights into customer exit patterns.

Project Description

The Customer Churn Analysis project aims to identify key drivers of customer churn within a banking context. It utilizes data analysis techniques to evaluate the following factors:

Demographics: Age, gender, and geography.

Behavior Indicators: Credit card status and credit score.

By analyzing these factors, we can develop strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.

Data Sources

The dataset used in this project comes from various sources, including:

Banking customer databases.

Publicly available datasets on customer demographics and behaviors.

The data is cleaned and pre-processed to ensure accuracy in analysis. You can find the dataset in the data folder.

Analysis Techniques

We employed several analysis techniques to understand customer churn:

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing data to understand customer demographics.

Visualizations: Creating charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms to predict churn.

These techniques help us draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive way to visualize the data. It includes:

Customer Demographics: Age, gender, and geographical distribution.

Churn Rates: Visual representation of churn rates over time.

Behavior Analysis: Insights into how behavior indicators affect churn.

To view the Power BI dashboard, you can download the files from the Releases section
 and open them in Power BI Desktop.

Excel Analysis

In addition to Power BI, we also performed analysis using Excel. The Excel files contain:

Raw data for manipulation.

Pivot tables to summarize data.

Charts for visual analysis.

These tools are helpful for those who prefer working with Excel for data analysis.

Insights and Findings

Through our analysis, we uncovered several key insights:

Age Factor: Younger customers showed higher churn rates compared to older customers.

Geographical Trends: Certain regions had significantly higher churn rates.

Credit Score Impact: Customers with lower credit scores were more likely to churn.

These insights can guide banks in tailoring their retention strategies.
